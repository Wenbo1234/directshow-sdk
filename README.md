# DirectShow SDK

This is an unofficial mirror for Microsoft's directshow. This only has a build script to build with Python.

You can get the official source from [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279).

## Building

Open /baseclasses/baseclasses.sln and build. You can build x64 and x86 in debug and release by running

```
./build.py
```
